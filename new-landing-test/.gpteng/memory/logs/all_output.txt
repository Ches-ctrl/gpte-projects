================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

Request: Create a basic landing page using rails


================================== Ai Message ==================================

To create a basic landing page using Ruby on Rails, we need to follow a structured approach. We'll start by setting up a new Rails application, then create the necessary controllers, views, and routes to display the landing page. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Set up the Rails application**: We'll create a new Rails application.
2. **Generate a controller**: We'll generate a controller to handle the landing page.
3. **Create a view**: We'll create a view for the landing page.
4. **Set up routes**: We'll configure the routes to point to the landing page.
5. **Add styling**: Optionally, we'll add some basic styling to the landing page.

Let's start with the implementation:

### Step 1: Set up the Rails application

First, we need to create a new Rails application. Open your terminal and run:

```sh
rails new landing_page_app
cd landing_page_app
```

### Step 2: Generate a controller

Next, we'll generate a controller named `Pages` with an action `home` for our landing page.

```sh
rails generate controller Pages home
```

This command will create several files, including the controller, view, and route for the `home` action.

### Step 3: Create a view

Now, let's edit the view file to display our landing page content. Open `app/views/pages/home.html.erb` and add the following content:

app/views/pages/home.html.erb
```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Landing Page</title>
  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
  <%= csp_meta_tag %>

  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
  <%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Welcome to Our Landing Page</h1>
    <p>This is a basic landing page created with Ruby on Rails.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 4: Set up routes

We need to configure the routes to point to our landing page. Open `config/routes.rb` and modify it as follows:

config/routes.rb
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'pages#home'
end
```

This sets the root path of our application to the `home` action of the `Pages` controller.

### Step 5: Add styling

Optionally, we can add some basic styling to our landing page. Open `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` and add the following CSS:

app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
```css
/*
 *= require_tree .
 *= require_self
 */

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.container {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 50px auto;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  text-align: center;
}

h1 {
  color: #333333;
}

p {
  color: #666666;
}
```

### Final Step: Verify the implementation

Start the Rails server to verify that everything is working correctly:

```sh
rails server
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the landing page with the content and styling we added.

### Gemfile

Ensure your `Gemfile` includes the necessary gems for a basic Rails application:

Gemfile
```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '~> 6.1.4'
gem 'puma', '~> 5.0'
gem 'sass-rails', '>= 6'
gem 'webpacker', '~> 5.0'
gem 'turbolinks', '~> 5'
gem 'jbuilder', '~> 2.7'
gem 'bootsnap', '>= 1.4.4', require: false

group :development, :test do
  gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.4'
  gem 'byebug', platforms: [:mri, :mingw, :x64_mingw]
end

group :development do
  gem 'web-console', '>= 4.1.0'
  gem 'listen', '~> 3.3'
  gem 'spring'
  gem 'spring-watcher-listen', '~> 2.0.0'
end

group :test do
  gem 'capybara', '>= 3.26'
  gem 'selenium-webdriver'
  gem 'webdrivers'
end

group :production do
  gem 'pg', '~> 1.1'
  gem 'rails_12factor'
end
```

Run `bundle install` to ensure all gems are installed.

This concludes a fully working implementation.
